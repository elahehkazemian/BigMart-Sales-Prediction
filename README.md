# BigMart-Sales-Prediction
BigMart sales dataset consists of 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 different outlets in different cities. The goal of the following project is to build a regression model to predict the sales of each of 1559 products for the following year in each of the 10 different BigMart outlets. The BigMart sales dataset also consists of certain attributes for each product and store. This model helps BigMart understand the properties of products and stores that play an important role in increasing their overall sales.

This project is proudly created by Harsh Nagoriya.
